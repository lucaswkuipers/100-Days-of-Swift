# 100-Days-of-Swift
Even though I already studied most of the topics covered by Paul Hudon's 100 Days of Swift, this is my attempt at seeing the iOS world through some new ordered perspective.  It is always quite fun to experiment consolidating existing skills by walking different paths. It expands our range of perception and understanding of old concepts, breaking through the shallow barrier of first encounters, diving into a deep and vast sea of brand new treasures.

I intend to follow the website's recommended pace and practices by watching the videos and documenting here (and maybe on LinkedIn) some of my journey and evolution!

Hopefully this repository and journalling may also come as resourceful to some! Feel free to contact me anytime! Cheers!
